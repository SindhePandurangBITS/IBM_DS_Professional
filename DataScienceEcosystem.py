# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **objectives:**
# - Python is a versatile programming language widely used in data science for its simplicity and extensive libraries.
# - Data science techniques like data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms are crucial for extracting insights from data.
# - Python's powerful libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib enable efficient data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
# - Understanding statistical concepts and hypothesis testing is fundamental for making informed decisions based on data.
# - Data science projects involve the entire workflow, from data collection and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and communication of results.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are
# * Python 
# * R
# * Sql
# * java

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[2]:


#In this arithmetic expression we first multiply the integers and then we do addition.
(3*4)+5


# In[11]:


#In this cell we will be converting minutes into hours by deviding with constant 60
x = 200
y = x/60
print(y)
